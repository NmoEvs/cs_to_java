# Lambda

* Lambda expressions in Java are similar to C# or C++ ones, except `->`.
* An interface type with only one abstract method is a funtional interface.
* A lambda type is a defined thanks to a functional interface.
* The package `java.util.function` provides standard functional interfaces.
* There is reference to method that you can pass as lambda function.
* There is no delegate in Java, but a lambda function or a reference to a method
  achieves the same.
