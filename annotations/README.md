# Annotations

* Java annotations are like C# attributes but has no equivalence in C++.
* They are metadata not affecting the operation of the annotated code.
* They can be used for several purposes such as detection of errors, generation
  of code.
* `@Override` checks that the method declaration overrides a superclass one.
* `@FunctionalInterface` checks that the interface contains only one abstract
  method.
* Annotations are largely used by frameworks to dynamically inject code at compile time or runtime
* Annotations can be set to classes, methods, fields, arguments,...
