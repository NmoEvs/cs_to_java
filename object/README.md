# Classes and Objects

* A class is the definition of an object.
* An object is an instance of a class.
* The phrase "instantiating a class" means the same thing as "creating an object." 
When you create an object, you are creating an "instance" of a class, therefore "instantiating" a class.
* All Java classes instances are children of `java.lang.Object`.
* The class of an object is an `Object` too.
* You can inherit from another class by using `extends` keyword.
* There is no multi-inheritance.
* A class declared `final` cannot be subclassed.
* A class is fully defined in one file, there is no partial class in Java. The name of the file
must match the name of the public class written in the file and the extension is `.java`.
* By default, a class is visible inside it's package and subpackages.
* A class marked as public is visible by all other classes.
